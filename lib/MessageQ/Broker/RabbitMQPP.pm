=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 publish ( $destination, \%data )

publish a message onto a given exchange. Exchange is a RabbitMQ specific
term for the input side of a queue. The exchange name may consist of special
characters interpreted by the broker implementation.

C<$exchange> is divided into parts, the exchange name, a routing key and
a series of header values.

=cut

sub publish {
    my ($self, $destination, $data) = @_;
    
    my ($exchange, $routing_key, %header) = split ':', $destination;
    
    $self->channel->publish(
        exchange => $exchange,
        data     => encode_json($data),
        header   => \%header,
    );
}

=head2 consume ( $queue )

tell the queue that this process wants to consume it

=cut

sub consume {
    my ($self, $queue) = @_;
    
    $self->channel->consume(
        queue => $queue,
    );
}

=head2 receive

receive the next message from a consuming queue. Will block until a message
is present.

=cut

sub receive {
    my $self = shift;
    
    my $response = $self->channel->receive;
    
    return MessageQ::Broker::RabbitMQPPMessage->new(
        channel => $self->channel,
        data    => $response,
    );
}

=head2 has_message

=cut

sub has_message {

    # does channel->get() work here?
}
